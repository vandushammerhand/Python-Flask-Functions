    "Why do I still live? What more do you want from me? I gave everything I had to you, to them. 
    Look what they've made of our dream. 
    This bloated, rotting carcass of an empire is driven not by reason and hope but by fear, hate and ignorance. 
    Better that we had all burned in the fires of Horus' ambition than live to see this."
    â€”Roboute Guilliman, primarch of the Ultramarines, reflecting upon the state of the Imperium of the late 41st Millennium and his devotion to the Emperor of Mankind.
