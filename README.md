# Python-Flask-Functions
This is a repository for Flask and its various functions that can be implemented in python
Flask is a web development framework developed in Python. It is easy to learn and use. Flask is “beginner-friendly” because it does not have boilerplate code or dependencies, which can distract from the primary function of an application.
Flask is known as a micro-framework because it is lightweight and only provides components that are essential. It only provides the necessary components for web development, such as routing, request handling, sessions, and so on. For the other functionalities such as data handling, the developer can write a custom module or use an extension. This approach avoids unnecessary boilerplate code, which is not even being used.
